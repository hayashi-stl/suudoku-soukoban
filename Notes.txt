Pushing

Between an entity and the entity in front, there are 4 types of relationships
they can have if the current entity wants to move:
* Blocking: Neither entity moves
* Phasing:  The current entity moves. The entity in front doesn't.
* Forcing:  Both entities move.
* Rigid:    Both entities move iff the entity in front can move without being squished.

Cases for the current entity:
* Block:    A block.
* Pushing:  A non-block entity doing the push.
* Inactive: Some entity that isn't pushing.

Cases for the entity in front:
* Pushable
* Non-pushable
combined with
* Block
* Non-block

Chart of relationships
         |       Block                  Non-block
         | Pushable  Non-pushable  Pushable  Non-pushable
---------+-----------------------------------------------
Block    | Rigid     Blocking      Forcing   Phasing
Pushing  | Rigid     Blocking      Phasing   Phasing
Inactive | Blocking  Blocking      Phasing   Phasing

When calling a function whose name starts with "u_", check for validity
of the current entity before doing anything else. These functions can
delete entities.

Events of the game (for ordering purposes)

* Player moves
* Player punches
* Baddy / Pushy moves
* Gravity acts

* Baddy is punched: decrement (or disappear if no counter)
* Baddy counter = 0: disappear
* Player & baddy collide: player disappears
* Player & coin collide: coin decrements (or disappears if no counter), coin is collected
* Coin counter = 0: disappear
* Coin collected: coin counter blocks increment neighboring counters
* Fixed block / spike stepped on: decrement
* Push block moved (not by gravity): decrement
